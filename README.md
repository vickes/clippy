# Clippy

[Clippy](https://felixrieseberg.github.io/clippy/) let's you run a variety of large language models (LLMs) locally on your computer while sticking with a user interface of the 1990s. Through Llama.cpp, it supports models in the popular GGUF format, which is to say most publicly available models. It comes with one-click installation support for Google's Gemma3, Meta's Llama 3.2, Microsoft's Phi-4, and Qwen's Qwen3.

It's a love letter and homage to the late, great Clippy, the assistant from Microsoft Office 1997. The character was designed by illustrator Kevan Atteberry, who created more than 15 potential characters for Microsoft's Office Assistants. This app is not affiliated, approved, or supported by Microsoft. Consider it software art. If you don't like it, consider it software satire.

It is also meant to be a reference implementation of [@electron/llm](https://github.com/electron/llm), hoping to help other developers of Electron apps make use of local language models.

## Features

- Simple, familiar, and classic chat interface. Send messages to your models, get a response.
- Batteries included: No complicated setup. Just open the app and chat away. Thanks to llama.cpp and `node-llama-cpp`, the app will automatically discover the most efficient way to run your models (Metal, CUDA, Vulkan, etc).
- Custom models, prompts, and parameters: Load your own downloaded models and play with the settings.
- **100% Offline & Local**: Everything runs on your computer. No cloud services, no external API calls, no data collection.
- **LAN API Server**: Built-in HTTP API server for accessing Clippy from other devices on your local network. Perfect for home automation, scripts, or mobile access. See [API.md](API.md) for details.

## Non-Features

Countless little chat apps for local LLMs exist out there. Many of them are likely better - and that's okay. This project isn't trying to be your best chat bot. I'd like you to enjoy a weird mix of nostalgia for 1990s technology paired with one the most magical technologies we can run on our computers in 2025.

## Downloading More Models

Clippy supports (thanks to Llama.cpp) most GGUF models. You can find GGUF models in plenty of online sources - I tend to go with models quantized by [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/thebloke) or [Unsloth](https://huggingface.co/unsloth).
